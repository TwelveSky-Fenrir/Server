-- RS4 (persisted buffs, game.CharacterBuffs) is currently read and reapplied by
-- EnterWorldService.BuildBuffInfo/BuildEffectValueForView on every normal world-entry via
-- GetWorldEntryBundleAsync -- see game.CharacterBuffs's own header comment for the legacy citation this
-- appears to contradict (legacy zeroes BUFF_INFO on every login) and why this schema doesn't unilaterally
-- gate the result set out. AutoHuntConfig NULL means "never configured".
--
-- RS0 (the first result set) is deliberately append-only at the tail: PreviousTribe/Mount*/AutoTime2/
-- Zone241Time/PetBagDate/WarPoint/M15PetLuckyBoxPity are appended after Exp2, never inserted mid-list.
-- CharacterWorldSnapshotDto (RS0's full projection, used by GetWorldEntryBundleAsync/EnterWorldService)
-- gains the new trailing fields; any new column goes after M15PetLuckyBoxPity.
--
-- CharacterWorldEntryDto (the narrow, stable 19-column prefix used by CreateAvatarService/ZoneTransferService/
-- ZoneHandshakeService) no longer reads this procedure at all -- it reads the single-result-set companion
-- usp_Character_GetForWorldEntrySummary.sql instead, which projects the identical 19 columns in the same
-- order. Both procedures must keep that 19-column prefix in sync if it ever changes.
